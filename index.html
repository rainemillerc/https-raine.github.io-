      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Welcome to my collection of sounds I’ve helped create over the last fifteen years of music production. My passion for music, sound design, and all things audio stems from my love of film and video games. It was always a pipe dream of mine to work within this field, always a ‘oh that would be cool to make music and sound for games and movies’, but now I’m working at making that dream a reality. </p>


<p>Initially I started out as a guitarist when I was about fifteen years old. I’d go on to play in a garage band with some friends from high school as my first collaborative experience in music. While it didn’t go anywhere, it did set a nice little foundation, which I used to join some far more experienced musicians in a new band when I was around nineteen or twenty. Under the name Stone Willow we played some gigs around Auckland, a few of which I helped organize and run, which was some great experience and an amazing time.</p>

<p>All the while I’d been recording my own solo music, first starting on an old mac book’s Garage Band, before getting myself a four track recorder, then finally landing on FL Studio as my DAW of choice. Slowly I began to teach myself how to design my own sounds and produce entire songs using my guitar as the skeleton of my music. I’d mainly work on ambient black metal and folk/acoustic songs as my skills grew to where I was able to create entire drum, bass and synth tracks.</p> 

<p>I’d go on to perform solo shows with these songs while also playing in a black metal two piece, Naust. During this I got far more experience with song writing, event coordinating, and networking within the scene on my own merits. Eventually, COVID hit, and we were all stuck inside. During the lockdowns in New Zealand I used the time to collaborate online with friends and musicians I’d made over the previous years. Under the name Nightmare Honey I released the first collection of songs to great reception. A couple songs got radio time, I even got interviewed on BFM, though unfortunately every single gig would end up getting canceled with a new lockdown.</p>

<p>The first release ended up getting a band, Elegant World, interested in picking me up as a bassist. I didn’t play or own a bass but was leant one and ended up learning ten to twelve songs in an unfamiliar genre in two weeks before our first gig together. While gigging we recorded our debut album at SAE while at the same time I began work on the next Nightmare Honey release. Both Elegant world and NH II were a massive diversion from my usual style and it really opened me up to learning more and more different genres.</p> 

<p>Switching up from the grunge/goth rock in the first Nightmare Honey release I began work with various EDM artists. I’d never made any kind of electronic music before, so I had to put in a bunch of effort to learn a whole new side of music production, which grew my desire to consume more and more styles and techniques.</p>

<p>I eventually moved cities for work and fell out of the music scene for a wee while as I was living in a small little apartment in a whole new place where I didn’t know many people at all. A year and half later I was back in Auckland playing in a noise band named Panadol. We recorded a few demos, played a few shows, and then my guitar pedals were stolen and I had to quit. Over the next year I just played bare bones guitar for myself, not recording, just learning how to play again. It had been about fifteen years since I first picked up a guitar and going right back to the basics felt almost refreshing. There I remembered my desire as a young teen to make music for games and film, and now I have all the experience I need to make that dream possible, so it’s time to put that foundation to use.</p>
